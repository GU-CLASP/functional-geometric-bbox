# Spatial descriptions on a functional-geometric spectrum: the location of objects
**Authors:** *Simon Dobnik and Mehdi Ghanimifard*

### Abstract

Experimental research on spatial descriptions shows that their
semantics are dependent on several modalities, among others (i) a
geometric representation of space ("where", geometric knowledge)
and (ii) dynamic kinematic routines between objects that are related
("what", functional knowledge). In this paper we examine whether
geometric and functional bias of spatial relations is also reflected
in large corpora of images and their corresponding descriptions. In
particular, we examine whether the variation in object locations in
the usage of a relation is a predictor of that relation's functional 
or geometric bias. Previous experimental psycho-linguistic work has 
examined the bias of some spatial relations, however our corpus-based 
computational analysis allows us to examine the bias of spatial relations 
and verbs beyond those that have been tested experimentally. Our findings
have also implications for building computational image descriptions 
systems as we demonstrate what kind of representational knowledge is 
required to model spatial relations contained in them.
